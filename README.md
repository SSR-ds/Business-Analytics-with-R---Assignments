# Business-Analytics-with-R-Assignments


Assignment 1: (Utilites dataset)

-> Read the data from utilities dataset
-> Compute the minimum, maximum, mean, median, std dev for the numeric values. Find which variable has the largest
   variability
-> Create box plot for the numeric variables. Find if there is any extreme values for any of the variables
-> Create heatmap and explain the interesting trend
-> Run PCA on the unscaled numeric variables and interpret the results from this model
-> Run PCA on the scaled numeric variables and interpret the results from this model


Assignment 2: (Airfares dataset)

-> Read the Airfares dataset
-> Create correlation table and scatter plots between the Fare and Predictors 
-> Create a data partition by splitting into train and test dataset
-> Run stepwise regression to reduce the number of predictors and discuss the results
-> Use exhaustive search instead of stepwise regression 
-> Compare predictive accuracy of stepwise and exhaustive search using RMSE
-> Using exhaustive search predict the average fare for given charactersitics
-> Using leaps package run backward selection regression to reduce the number of predictors
-> Run backward selection using stepAIC() function  

Assignment 3: (spambase data)

-> Read the spambase dataset
-> Examine how the predictor differs between the spam and non spam emails by comparing spam class with non spam class average. Identify the 10 predictors for which the average      of difference is highest
-> Perform LDA on the training dataset
-> Find the coefficients of Linear discriminants
-> Generate LDA using our analysis. Explain how they are helpful in classifying spams and non spams
-> Find how many LDAs are present in the model
-> Generate LDA using training and validation data and find what information is presented in the plots
-> Generate confusion matrix and calculate the specificity and sensitivity
-> Generate lift and decile charts for the validation datasets
-> Find accuracy by changing the probability threshold
